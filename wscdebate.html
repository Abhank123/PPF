    <div class="container-fluid" id="wscc">WSC Debate Tips</div>

    
    <div class="container-fluid content">Greetings scholars! We’re extremely honored to have you looking at our debate tips. Knowing that some of you may be beginners at WSC debate or debating in general, we’ve made this guide as simple as possible. This guide will give you the building blocks to ascend to the next level (aka boss). Enjoy!
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid redd">So, what is WSC Debate?</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">Debate, in my opinion, is the most thrilling, and energetic academic event in the World Scholar’s Cup. You get to debate, on extremely interesting motions, based on the WSC syllabus, which would never even arise in a normal conversation.<br><br>Speaking from experience, I can say that this event definitely improves your thinking and communication skills.<br><br>The good part and bad part about WSC debate, is that scholars are free to use whatever speech format they want as long as they keep it under four minutes (I’ll dwell on rules later). For beginners, this is lifesaving, as it allows you to learn yourself with different formats, and then finalize on the one you’re strongest in. I think this is extremely important, as it gives you experience, and allows you to explore your weaknesses and strengths.<br><br>Now that bad part. Since WSC debate doesn’t follow a specific speech format, it’s extremely hard to judge which one is essentially ‘the best’, and oftentimes, debate judges have different opinions, which can result in either your rank going up, or your rank going down. There’s barely anything you can do about it, but I would suggest to keep practicing in your format (I’ll also explain my preferred format) regularly, because apart from format, your points must be crisp and concise. The more you practice, the higher your rank will be, regardless of speech format.</div>
    <div class="container-fluid redd">WSC Format</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">I love the WSC Debate format, simply because it allows you to do what you want without distractions. To put things into perspective, I’ll take Model UN format as an example (apologies munners).<br><br>In an MUN, your speech can be interrupted, with different things such as Point of Personal Privileges, and there are some specific things you need to follow such as speaking in third person, and it’s more restricting.<br><br>That’s why I like WSC Debate, because it allows you to be who you are, and it’s a more comfortable and friendly experience. Apart from that, it allows you to slowly develop your confidence (unless you make it debate showcase in one go), as there are barely any spectators. It’s just you, your team, the adjudicator, and the opposing team.<br><br>Now coming to rules and formats. It’s quite easy to understand, so I’ll briefly explain.</div>

    <div class="container-fluid subcontent">Who’s in the room with you?</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">Ideally, a WSC debate room consists of you, and your team mates sitting together. Opposite you sits the opposition team. Next to you, and your opposition, is where the adjudicator will be sitting. Rarely, debates also have an audience of 2-3 people and they would sit in the back of the room to spectate.<br><br><span class="imgwrap container-fluid"><img class="imagess" src="debateroomimg.jpg"></span>Note than you can stand where ever you want, but the center is always the best (even if the adjudicator tells you to stand somewhere, you’re not obliged to).</div>
    <div class="container-fluid subcontent">How does the debate begin?</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">Once everyone is in the room, and no one is missing, the adjudicator will begin to start off with the rules. After reading the rules, he/she will read out the motion.</div>
    <div class="container-fluid subcontent">What’s a motion (I’ll dwell on this in detail later)?</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">A motion (also called agenda), is the topic that you will be debating upon.</div>
    <div class="container-fluid subcontent">Okay so what’s the format?!</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">-The adjudicator will read out the rules, and will give the motion<br>-Once the motion is given, teams will have 15 minutes to research and discuss with team mates<br>-After, the first speaker of the affirmative side will go, and can speak up to 4 minutes without any interruptions<br>-After the speaker is done with his/her speech, teams will have 1 minute until the negative speaker delivers his/her speech<br>-The process goes on until all are done speaking, and after a 90 second feedback interval occurs (I’ll explain later)<br><br>Note: There are no interruptions, and doing so is a violation of rules and you CAN lose your points. 
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid redd">WSC Debate Scoring</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">The maximum raw score in WSC debate is 21 (individual) and is scored based on three criteria namely:<br>-   Presentation (out of 7)<br>-   Strategy (out of 7)<br>-   Content (out of 7)
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid subcontent">Presentation</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">In layman’s terms, presentation is basically how you present yourself. Your body language, your hand movements, the number of times you say ‘ums’ and ‘uhhs’, and so on.</div>
    <div class="container-fluid subcontent">Strategy</div>
    <div class="container-fluid content">Questions that can arise when marking:<br><br>1.  What is your speaker format? <br>In strategy, the adjudicator may ask this question. He/she may examine how you’ve framed your speech, and whether your speech flowed from point to point (basically a linkage between two ideas). Again, like I said, different judges have different opinions, and therefore speak in whichever format you want. <br><br>2.  Is there cohesion within the team?<br>This is another question that may come up in strategy. The simple definition of cohesion is ‘the action or fact of forming a united whole.’ What this means in debate is that your team’s points should connect together, and make sense when tied back to the motion. For this, you need team work.<br><br>3.  Do the ideas flow, and connect?<br>
    In your speech, the adjudicator may want to see if your ideas can connect with each other. For example, when you’re writing a speech in school, different paragraphs are for different points and your English teacher may want to see if you are able to connect one paragraph to another.
</div>
<div class="container-fluid subcontent">Content</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Questions that can arise:<br><br>
1.  Did you make use of the WSC syllabus?<br>
The WSC syllabus is extensive, and oftentimes, debate motions are based on these. Thus, adjudicators may examine to what extent you’ve used the syllabus in your speeches (maybe in the form of hook statements, or general points)<br><br>
2.  Is everything you’ve said related to the motion?<br>  
Oftentimes, debate speeches tend to drift away from the motion and the adjudicator will look at the relevance of your content and whether or not it proves your stance and points (although that’s also up to the opposition to point out.<br><br> 
For example, if you’re speaking on the motion: Diplomacy is simply the art of lying, but the affirmative team says James Bond always lies during his foreign missions (It’s a funny story, I’ll explain later), then it isn’t even related to the motion, because James Bond isn’t a diplomat.
It’s also important that you have facts, and data as well.
</div>
<div class="container-fluid redd">The Motion</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Suppose you and your friend watched the U.S Presidential Debate that took place on September 30th. Your friend tells you that Donald Trump won, but you say Joe Biden.<br><br>
In this scenario, you’re debating about an event that happened, which is the U.S Presidential Debate. That would be your topic of discussion.<br><br>
We can convert this into a motion by making it one-sided. ‘The house believes: that Joe Biden won the U.S Presidential Debate’. This would be your motion, with you being in favor, and your friend being against.
</div>
<div class="container-fluid redd">Speaker Duties</div>
<div class="container-fluid subcontent">Basic Duties of a First Speaker</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">In a speech/academic essay, you have an introduction, then a body, then a conclusion, and then an end. In this case, the first speaker is the introduction, and it is extremely important that the debate opens up in your favor.  I’ll tell you how to do that.<br><br>Interpretations:<br><br>An interpretation is essentially the way you understand a concept or a topic, and in this case, the motion. I cannot stress enough on this, because the flow of the debate will be based on how both teams and the adjudicator perceive the motion, and it’s up to the first speaker to convince which is best.<br><br>For example, I’ll take the example of the motion ‘it is ethical for a diplomat to lie in the interest of his/her country’.<br><br>Out of the 15 minutes of research time given, I suggest you contribute at least 3 to this. You should note down the following:<br>
-   Key terms of the motion (in this case the word ‘diplomacy’, and ‘lying’)<br>
-   Definitions these key terms<br><br>
a.  Now this is tricky. First you should look at the dictionary meaning, and see if it suits your team. Think about how the opposition would define this term, and if you feel they would define it the same way as you, there’s no need to change it.<br>
b.  Some words may require more thinking, for example the world lying can provoke the following questions:<br>
i.  Is it ethical to lie, when not under duress?<br>
ii. Is it right to lie, when hundreds of lives are in danger?<br>
iii.    Is it indeed patriotic to lie for your own country, even if it puts another in danger?<br><br>
You must think of these questions, not just for prebuttals (explained under), but to clear any confusions. For example, you can give the dictionary definition of the word ‘lying’, and then give your interpretation.<br>
The affirmative first speaker may say: ‘According to dictionary.com, lying is defined as being deliberately untruthful’, without giving interpretation,
Or the affirmative first speaker can say: lying is being deliberately untruthful, and the affirmative team would further like to say it’s perfectly ethical to lie in the interest of one’s country, even if other countries may be in danger, and we’ll explain why (not my best example but you get the gist).

Or for this word, you can simply define it and hope that the opposition instead sets the boundaries in your favor but that’s risky.<br><br>Signposting: essentially what everyone is going to talk about.<br><br>
A boring example of this is: Now before I begin, I would like to highlight what our (not mine) team will be covering today. I, the first speaker, will be defining the motion, prebutting, rebutting the opposition (if you’re in the negative team), and listing our main arguments. Our second speaker will be covering all arguments and will be rebutting the opposition, and our third speaker will be rebutting, summing up the debate, and concluding.<br><br>
Without signposting, your adjudicator will be caught off guard and will therefore take more time to understand the formats and speeches.<br><br>Prebuttals<br><br>We know what rebuttals are, but we don’t know what prebuttals are. Prebuttals are essentially rebutting before the opposition says something and it’s extremely important to do this because sometimes you disprove some of the opposition’s points before they say them and it’s a very sly, yet permissible tactic.
Oftentimes, when one of my first speakers, or I, prebut, we see the opposition team banging their heads and looking at each other (not saying it means anything but…)<br><br>

For example, you can think of the questions mentioned in ‘b’, or I’ll just put them here again.<br>
i.  Is it ethical to lie, when not under duress?<br>
ii. Is it right to lie, when hundreds of lives are in danger?<br>
iii.    Is it indeed patriotic to lie for your own country, even if it puts another in danger?<br>
If you’re an affirmative first speaker, you mean to speak COMPLETELY in favor of the motion. Therefore think about what points the opposition may say and instantly try to disprove them.<br><br>
For example, you can say: the opposition may say that lying in the interest of your nation is not ethical, when you are not under duress of any type, however that point can be nullified, as lying in diplomacy when not under duress can have positive outcomes + your own example.<br><br>Main Points<br><br>Note that the job of a first speaker is not to explain the points, but to simply list them. It’s important for you to bring in your strongest points as early as possible in order to combat the opposition’s, and the first speakers normally introduce them.




</div>
<div class="container-fluid subcontent">Basic Duties of a Second Speaker</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">The second speaker is essentially the body of an essay and covers all points and rebuts (I’ll explain this in detail later).<br><br>
Main points: <br><br>
The second speaker is in charge of bringing out all main points. I’m not sure what to put here as I will be explaining rebuttals and research later.
</div>
<div class="container-fluid subcontent">Basic Duties of a Third Speaker</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">The third speaker ideally closes the team’s case. In my opinion, the third speaker is the hardest to pull off out of all speakers, and therefore whoever takes this position must be the most experienced in debate in your team. If you can pull this off effectively, your rank will be extremely high.<br><br>
Although third speakers do not ‘win’ the debate or ‘carry’ the team, their ranks generally tend to be higher than the other speakers (as to what I’ve noticed). But again, the more you practice, the higher your rank so you can disprove my theory!<br><br>
The third speaker is in charge of rebutting and concluding.
In this speaker position, you shouldn’t really introduce any new points, (especially if you’re on the negative team), as it’ll take a long time for the adjudicator to digest. Instead you should be rebutting and restating all the points in one line each.
Here’s how you divide your research: research for your second and first speaker, and give them your points. Along with that, keep conversing with them and note down the points the team will talk about with one example at least.<br>
Next, just relax and analyze the opposition’s speeches and see if you can find rebuttals (NOTE THEM DOWN IMMEDIATELY or else you’ll forget).<br><br>
Now start your speech: <br>
1.  Do your rebuttals first<br>
2.  Summary: Basically what the team has said. For example, you can say: So what has our side of the house said today? We’ve talked about [Your Point], and we proved it by [your example]<br>
3.  As a part of the summary, you will also summarize what the opposition has said: but what has the opposition said today? They said [what they said] and we instantly disproved it by [what you said]<br>
4.  Conclusion: The conclusion is the most important part of a third speaker’s speech as it leaves the final impression on the adjudicator. I normally do my conclusions like this (I’m using the motion ‘that we should welcome extra-terrestrial beings to Earth’): ‘So it all comes down to this. Do you want a world, which is plagued by poverty, and famine, and where we are waging a never ending war against beings who can wipe us off the face of the Earth, because that is what the opposition proposes. On the contrary, our side of the house welcomes a just, and technologically advanced world, where we can co-habit with species from different planets’ 

</div>

<div class="container-fluid redd">Research</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Research, is undoubtedly the most important in a debate, and it can determine whether or not you win. It’s therefore important that you know how to do it.<br><br>
Note that this should be a team effort, and I’ll tell you how to research depending on what speaker you are:<br>
DO NOT USE WIKIPEDIA WHATSOEVER!! YOUR POINTS CAN BE CONSIDERED INVALID<br><br>
You should try to use the following sources when gathering points:<br><br>
1.  Ending with .org, .edu, .gov<br>
These sources are generally regarded as trustworthy and stating these sources can prevent the opposition from saying it’s false (as I’ve seen multiple times)<br>
2.  Any news source that is aligned center, lean left, or lean right (Try not to use far right or far left because there are a lot of biased opinions).
I would honestly suggest using center aligned sources because they’re unbiased. For example, if you use a far-left source to prove your point, the opposition may point out that it’s not considering both sides of the view.<br>
3.  In my opinion, the best news source is always ‘Reuters’.<br>
Seriously use this.<br>
4.  When gathering statistics, use ‘statista.com’<br>
In all my years of debating, statista has always been by my side. It provides relevant, and valid statistics that are easy to find.<br>
5.  Once getting the motion, try searching it on ‘debate.org’.<br> 
You may call this cheap, but a great way to research is simply copy paste the motion on a search bar (this won’t give you all points but gives you a general answer). Debate.org ideally has a lot of different motions where you can read both sides and form points and prebuttals.<br><br>
This is theoretical researching. Now I’m going to dwell on creative research (this isn’t an actual word):<br><br>
You HAVE to make use of the WSC Syllabus, and therefore, before going on the web, link your motion to a WSC subject and thoroughly go through the page, to see if there are any examples you can use from there. Once you have them, note them down and research.<br>
In creative researching, I also include pathos (logos is above, and ethos isn’t really needed):<br>
Pathos is essentially using emotion to sway your audience into listening to your points. In a debate, you can use pathos in your speeches by including hook statements.
For example, if we’re talking about aliens coming to Earth and your team has to speak in favor of that: I want you to imagine a world, where us humans live in peace and prosperity, where we don’t have to fight to get basic necessities. This is all possible, if we welcome extra terrestrial beings to our world in open arms.<br><br>

The most important aspect of WSC debate when it comes to research is simply knowing the WSC Syllabus. Oftentimes, the motions are based on the syllabus, and if you know it, you can include points from there and rebut as well.

</div>
<div class="container-fluid redd">Getting the Right Research</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">This may sound confusing, but what I’ve noticed, is that sometimes a team’s research doesn’t flow, and it doesn’t match their interpretation of the motion very well.<br><br>
This is why it’s important to discuss with your team. Once you get the motion, spend maximum 3 minutes scaffolding the motion with your team, so all of you are on the same page. After that:<br>
1.  The first speaker may:<br>
-   Research Key terms and interpret the motion<br>
-   Think of prebuttals<br>
-   In the last 5 minutes of research:<br>
a.  Gather main points and one example from team mates<br>
b.  Draft sign posting<br><br>
2.  The second speaker may:<br>
-   Just research on all main points, with examples (make sure these are in your favor and matches your interpretation of the motion)<br><br>
3.  The third speaker may:<br>
-   Research main points to help first and second speaker<br>
-   In the 60 second breaks may draft rebuttals and conclusions.<br>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid redd">Rebuttals</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Honestly, I love rebutting, because it gives you so much satisfaction when you prove someone’s points wrong. But rebuttals aren’t just to disprove an opposition’s points, it’s also to prove your points superior.<br><br>

So what are rebuttals?<br>
Simply put, a rebuttal is breaking down an opposition’s argument and disproving it.
Rebuttals are an extremely important part of a debate as it can convince an adjudicator which points are correct and which are wrong, but it can backfire so take a list of the don’ts:<br><br>
a.  No swearing:
Debate is a formal argument, and swearing (even words like ‘stupid’, or ‘idiot’) will lose you points<br>
b.  No pointing:
Oftentimes, opposition teams try to use their fingers to point them in your face, in order to try and intimidate you, but it’s actually extremely irritating, and distracting. There are two ways in which the adjudicator may mark you down:<br>
-   He/she will either look at your opposition’s reactions to you pointing your finger, and will not pay attention to your points or<br>
-   He/she will mark you down for disrespect<br>
c.  No direct conversation (Explained in debate experiences)<br>
Let me give you an example of how a rebuttal works.
Suppose the motion is again ‘Diplomacy is the art of lying’. Now the affirmative team may say this point (although no one is so incompetent to mention it): James Bond was a diplomat, and he always had to lie for his country.<br>
How would you as the negative speaker rebut this? You could easily say: It seems that the opposition has not researched upon this motion thoroughly, because they mentioned that James Bond was a diplomat, and he had to lie for his country. This point is absolutely unwarranted, and irrelevant, as James Bond was not a diplomat, and is a secret service agent.<br>
You can also say it’s a fictional reference and therefore further irrelevant, but that’s normally for the adjudicator to decide.
</div>

<div class="container-fluid redd">Presenting Your Points</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">When presenting my points, I always use FEEL. Let me break it down:<br><br>

1.  F for factor: This is the point that you’re trying to convey<br>
2.  E for explanation: You can explain your point afterwards<br>
3.  E for evidence: Provides facts, or statistics to support your points<br>
4.  L for link: Link your point back to your stance on the motion (for example: This point clearly proves the aliens should be allowed to immigrate to Earth)
This format covers almost all aspects of an argument. Factor would allow the adjudicator to remember your line in one word, explanation would allow the adjudicator to understand it, evidence would allow the judge to believe in it, and link would allow the judge to understand it’s relevance to the motion.
</div>

<div class="container-fluid redd">Feedback</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Feedback is marked and each team gets 90 seconds to do so. My team and I follow a specific format which involves A LOT of sugarcoating (but it’s still meaningful).<br><br>
Good point about speech -> Something that could be improved -> Good point again<br><br>
Note that every speaker should give feedback and not just one speaker in the team.
</div>
<div class="container-fluid redd">Some of my Dearest WSC Debate Experiences</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Scholars! These are some of my most memorable WSC Debate memories, that have taught me lessons, and will hopefully teach you too.</div>
<div class="container-fluid subcontent">1. Stress and Spitting</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">It was in 2018, when I flew to Chandigarh with a new team, all geared up as first year scholars. We stayed at a nice hotel, and had butter chicken. The food I ate, however, is not what I want to talk about.<br><br>
Getting to the venue: As we hopped in the car, the pressure got to me, and I caught a splitting headache. My team mates started scolding me, telling me to ‘chill out’, but it kept getting worse, because this was the first time I was participating in an academic competition. When I got to the venue however, I saw a welcoming staff, and plenty of excited and happy scholars. My headache immediately went away.<br>
Now this is not related to WSC Debate, but I just want to say that there’s no point in being stressed, because it’ll do more harm. So keep your cool, and do what you can.<br><br>
Debate: Debate in Chandigarh was eventful. I remember that it was the last round, and our team confidently walked in, having won the last two debates. We waited and waited for around ten minutes, until the opposition team walked in. They seemed our age, but were quite intimidating.
I remember my team mates glancing at each other in uneasiness as the opposition glared at us. The adjudicator finally read out the motion which was (you guessed it right): Diplomacy is the art of lying. <br><br>As we researched, we would see the opposition team chatting away, and laughing, and we instantly knew we were going to lose. They seemed so relaxed, yet here we were, peering into our LED screens, with our legs bouncing up and down in stress.
The time then came for the affirmative team to send in their first speaker. She got up, dressed in formal uniform, wearing shiny black heels, and walked towards the front. Before she began, she glared at us, hoping to intimidate.<br><br>
She looked into her notebook, and began, with an ear-splitting shriek. We were taken aback, and were frightened at the way she was speaking. After her introduction, she moved onto her main points. 
Her voice was loud, and consequently, she began to spit everywhere. Since she was facing towards us, and pointing her fingers in our face, we tried not to flinch when we saw her spit flying towards us. The adjudicator also saw this, and her reaction was priceless.<br><br>
But then came the point of the century, where my team and I silently chuckled. She stated that James Bond was a diplomat, and he lied all the time. We ended up laughing, but we saw her team mates loudly pounding the table in appreciation.<br><br>
Before her speech ended, she pointed at us and started directly talking to us, and went and sat back down.
We eventually won the debate, and I think it was because we called out that James Bond point. As we exited the room, we burst out laughing at what we had encountered.
I ended up coming second individually in debate. <br><br>


Debate Morals:<br>
-   Never ever read points from a notebook, try flashcards instead<br>
-   Work with your team, as it’ll bring cohesion and you can validate your points<br>
-   NEVER EVER talk directly to the opposition: you need to convince the adjudicator, not your opposition<br>
-   Do not be aggressive, in a sense that involves raising your voice, glaring, and pointing fingers. Instead, use your words <br>
-   Do not pound the table: That’s MUN culture and in a WSC debate, it’s quite distracting, since there are very few people in the room<br>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid subcontent">2. Debate and Drama</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">Here we fast forward to the 2019 Hague Global Round, and the glamorous campus of Erasmus University. My team and I were walking into our second round. We settled down and greeted the adjudicator. Opposite us sat a mixed team from Kenya and Uganda. The adjudicator gave us the motion which was something about automation taking over jobs and we instantly started researching and discussing. We were affirmative, which meant that we had to talk in favor of automation not taking over jobs, and after our speeches, came the second speaker of the negative side. I think he was maybe 18 years old. <br><br>
He began his speech, but there was something extremely peculiar about it. He started miming his points. For those of you who don’t know what miming is, watch ‘Charlie Chaplin’. <br><br>
What was his point?<br>
He wanted to say that the introduction of automation, would prevent injuries. But rather than to provide concrete evidence, he decided to mime.
He pretended that he was a construction worker, and was hammering a nail. He placed one hand on an imaginary wall, and held an imaginary nail, and one hand held an imaginary hammer. He proceeded to hammer the nail, until his imaginary hammer hit the hand holding the nail. He proceeded to say ‘BOOM BOOM, and I am gone’.
What he was trying to say is that injuries are common, and he showed that by a hammer hitting your hand. <br>His message was that automation can stop all of that. 
Now I must admit, that it was witty, and creative, but simply wasn’t what to do in a debate.<br><br>
I’m sure the learnings here are obvious, but I’ll cover it:<br>
-   Argue with your words, not with acting (in my humble opinion)<br>
-   Back your arguments with facts, as it makes your points more credible<br>
-   If you want to express something, do it through facial expressions and hand gestures<br>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid subcontent">3. Confrontational Conversation</div>
<div class="container-fluid content">The last one and the most hilarious experience took place at a Regional Round in December 2019. We were debating on the motion ‘That Google should filter search results based on intelligence’. Our side was for this motion.<br><br>
We instantly knew that this was not in our favor, but somehow won, and I think I know why. First of all, it was a two-member team, and secondly, their speeches were quite strange.<br><br>
The second speaker came onto the podium, and started confronting and accusing us. I remember him pointing at us, and screaming ‘YOU SIR, YOU WANT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE’. He continuously screamed at us in a confrontational manner, until he asked us a question, in which he wanted an answer, but we cunningly refused to answer. Now I might be way too judgmental, but once his speech ended, my team and I burst out laughing, because we had never seen a speech like that. The adjudicator saw us laughing and I’m pretty sure we were marked down because of that.<br><br>
Some Learnings:<br>
-   Never laugh, or show any expression to your opposition. If you have the urge to laugh, bite your tongue, or look away.<br>
-   NEVER EVER confront your opposition because it is considered rude, and disrespectful. Your job is to convince the adjudicator, not your opposition<br>
-   Do not ever ask questions which you expect an answer to. A rhetorical question works well however.
