		<div class="container-fluid" id="wscwhatisit"><span>The World Scholar's Cup (WSC) is an international academic tournament, comprising of four main events namely: Debate, Collaborative Writing, the Scholar's Challenge (based on the WSC Syllabus), and the Scholar's Bowl (also based on the WSC Syllabus).

A few pointers are listed below:<br> <br> 1. There are three rounds in which teams can either be positive (for the motion) or negative (against the motion). <br> 2. In each round, a team will get fifteen minutes to research and discuss with each other. <br> 3. The debate will then begin with the positive side going first. <br> 4. After all speakers have spoken, there is then a feedback round. <br> 5. The winner is announced. <br><br> For more information, check out their website <a id="scholhype" href="http://scholarscup.org/">here</a></rp></span></div>
